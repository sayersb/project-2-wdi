## Intro

A full-stack Node App that includes information on players and countries for the 2018 Fifa World Cup, leading to predictions being made by users (that are visible once logged in). This was my first full stack app, built with Express.js and Node.js amongst the other technologies shown in the table below : 


| JavaScript(ECMAScript6)        | HTML5           | CSS3  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| EJS      | Express.js | MongoDB |
| Mongoose      | Node.js      |   Yarn |
| Bulma |   method-override   |    Morgan |
| Session Authentication | bcrypt     |    body-parser |
